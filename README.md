Coderbyte challenges: my solutions

I'm preparing for coding school. These are my solutions in JavaScript for the Coderbyte (coderbyte.com) challenges I've completed. I haven't refactored yet, my focus was on solving as quickly as well as coming up with the best algorithm for each challenge. I also attempted to solve the problems with as few lines of code as possible.
